<p:‎I don’t remember when the book entered my house.
‎I only remember the moment it refused to leave my mind.
‎
‎(Mujhe yaad nahi ye sab kab shuru hua,
‎bas itna yaad hai ki ye khud khatam nahi hua.)
‎ was already there when I noticed it, resting on the lowest shelf of my father’s cupboard, hidden behind files no one had opened in years.
‎The cover was plain, almost deliberately so.
‎No title.
‎No author.
‎Just a dull brown surface, worn smooth by hands I couldn’t remember.
‎(Kabhi-kabhi jo cheez sabse simple lagti hai,
‎wahi sabse zyada heavy hoti hai.)
‎I would have ignored it.
‎I always ignore things that don’t belong to me.
‎But that night, the power went out at exactly 2:17 a.m.
‎(Not a normal   blackout.
‎Bilkul sudden)
‎The fan slowed.
‎The clock stopped ticking.
‎And the silence that followed felt aware.
‎(Ye wali khamoshi normal nahi thi,
‎jaise koi sun raha ho.)
‎I reached for my phone.
‎No battery.
‎No signal.
‎Dead.
‎That’s when the smell reached me.
‎Old paper.
‎Dust.
‎And something faintly metallic, like rain hitting rust.
‎(Kuch smells sirf yaadein nahi,
‎uneasy feeling bhi le aati hain.
‎The cupboard door was open.
‎I was sure I had closed it.
‎The book was no longer on the shelf.
‎It lay on the floor, right in the center of the room,
‎as if it had chosen the place itself.
‎(Jaise kisi ne decide karke use yahin rakha ho.)
‎When I bent down to pick it up, a sharp pressure formed behind my eyes.
‎Not pain.
‎Not yet.
‎More like something tightening, pulling inward.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi dard aane se pehle hi
‎dimag warning de deta hai.)
‎
‎I dropped the book instantly
‎
‎My hand trembled.
‎
‎Calm down, I whispered.
‎You’re overthinking.
‎
‎(Par dimaag maan nahi raha tha.)
‎
‎I picked it up again, slower this time.
‎The cover felt warm.
‎
‎Not warm like sunlight.
<p classic="Font:cursive">ursiveursive h
‎(Kuch cheezein zinda hone ke liye
‎heartbeat ki zarurat nahi hoti.)
‎
‎On the inside of the first page, something had been written
‎Not printed.
‎Written.
‎
‎You were here before.
‎
‎(Maine khud se poocha —
‎before what.)
‎
‎My throat tightened.
‎
‎Before tonight.
‎Before this room.
‎Before me.
‎
‎(Sawaal zyada the,
‎answers bilkul nahi.)
‎
‎I turned the page.
‎
‎The handwriting changed.
‎Cleaner.
‎Steadier.
‎
‎If you are reading this, it means you forgot again.
‎
‎(Mujhe hansi aani chahiye thi,
‎par nahi aayi.)
‎
‎This is stupid, I said out loud.
‎Some kind of prank.
‎
‎Par ek thought dheere se dimaag me ghusa.
‎
‎What if I had written this myself.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi sach mazaak jaisa lagta hai.)
‎
‎The next few pages were blank.
‎Too blank.
‎As if they were waiting.
‎
‎(Maine book band kar di.)
‎
‎That’s when the memory slipped.
‎
‎No flash.
‎No dizziness.
‎
‎Just absence.
‎
‎(Kuch yaadein jaate waqt awaaz bhi nahi karti.)
‎
‎For a few seconds, I couldn’t remember my father’s face.
‎
‎I stood frozen, staring at the wall.
‎His voice.
‎His habits.
‎The way he knocked twice before entering my room.
‎
‎Nothing came.
‎
‎(Is baar darr clearly feel hua.)
‎
‎My chest tightened.
‎
‎No, I whispered.
‎That’s not possible.
‎
‎I opened the book again, hands shaking now.
‎
‎A new line had appeared on the last page.
‎
‎He is closer when you forget.
‎
‎(Jaise koi mujhe yaad dilana chaah raha ho,
‎ki main akela nahi hoon.)
‎
‎The lights flickered back on.
‎
‎The fan started spinning.
‎The clock resumed ticking.
‎
‎The cupboard door closed itself with a soft, final sound.
‎
‎(Jaise decision final ho chuka ho.)
‎
‎And deep inside me, something settled comfortably,
‎as if it had been waiting for permission.
‎
‎(Tab mujhe samajh aa gaya —
‎ye book yaad rakhne ke liye nahi,
‎bhulwane ke liye aayi hai.)
‎
‎I closed the book slowly.
‎
‎I didn’t throw it away.
‎I didn’t burn it.
‎I didn’t tell anyone.
‎
‎(Kyunki kuch cheezein batayi nahi jaati,
‎mehsoos ki jaati hain.)
‎
‎This book wasn’t here to be read.
‎
‎It was here to remember.
‎
‎I was about to turn off the light when I heard it.
‎
‎A soft knock.
‎
‎Two taps.
‎
‎The exact way my father used to knock.
‎
‎My breath caught.
‎
‎He had been dead for years.
‎
‎(Kuch awaazein sirf darwaza nahi,
‎yaadein bhi khol deti hain.)
‎
‎I turned back to the book.
‎
‎A new line had appeared, written in a steadier hand than before.
‎
‎You will not wake up remembering who you are.
‎
‎My fingers tightened around the cover.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi warning bachane ke liye nahi hoti,
‎sirf batane ke liye hoti hai.)
‎
‎I knew what answering the knock meant.
‎By morning, I would wake up as someone else
‎
‎CHAPTER 2
‎The Door That Should Not Open.
‎
‎I stood there longer than I should have.
‎
‎The knock had already happened.
‎Answering it felt unnecessary—almost ceremonial.
‎
‎(Kuch cheezein decision nahi hoti.
‎Sirf follow hoti hain.)
‎
‎My hand hovered an inch from the handle.
‎Not shaking with fear—
‎but with a strange familiarity.
‎
‎As if my body remembered this moment,
‎even if my mind didn’t.
‎
‎The handle was colder than expected.
‎
‎Not metal-cold.
‎Skin-cold.
‎
‎Behind me, the room was too quiet.
‎Not silent—
‎listening.
‎
‎The book lay open on the floor.
‎A page turned by itself.
‎
‎I didn’t look.
‎I already knew what it would say.
‎
‎When my fingers finally closed around the handle,
‎something tightened inside my chest.
‎
‎Not pain.
‎Not yet.
‎
‎More like something preparing to leave.
‎I pulled the door open.
‎
‎The hallway was empty.
‎
‎No figure.
‎No shadow.
‎
‎Just the smell—
‎old paper, dust, and something faintly metallic.
‎
‎And then I heard it.
‎
‎Behind me.
‎
‎A page turning.
‎
‎The page stopped turning.
‎
‎The room felt lighter.
‎
‎Not safer.
‎Just… quieter.
‎
‎That was when I understood what the book did.
‎
‎It didn’t take memories away.
‎
‎It replaced them.
‎
‎The fear didn’t disappear.
‎It was exchanged—for calm.
‎
‎A wrong kind of calm.
‎
‎The kind that makes you stop asking questions.
‎
‎(The book bhoolne ko nahi kehti.
‎Bas mehsoos karna band karwa deti hai.)
‎
‎I realized why I wasn’t running.
‎
‎Why my hands had stopped shaking.
‎
‎Why my heart was suddenly steady,
‎even though it shouldn’t have been.
‎
‎Nothing was fine.
‎
‎I just felt like it was.
‎
‎That scared me more than panic ever could.
‎
‎(Kyunki jab darr hi mehsoos na ho,
‎toh bachaav ka khayal bhi nahi aata.)
‎The book lay still now.
‎
‎As if satisfied.
‎
‎As if it had completed a small task.
‎
‎I understood the first real rule then.
‎
‎You don’t forget everything—
‎only what keeps you human.
‎
‎Aur jab woh chala jaata hai,
‎toh galat cheezein bhi sahi lagne lagti hain.
‎
‎The calm didn’t last.
‎
‎It never does.
‎
‎A sound leaked into the room,
‎soft and careful.
‎
‎My name.
‎
‎Spoken the way my father used to say it
‎when he didn’t want to wake anyone else.
‎
‎Not loud.
‎Not urgent.
‎
‎Tired.
‎
‎And that’s when I understood the second rule.
‎
‎He sounds most like himself
‎when you are tired.
‎
‎(Thakaan mein awaazein sach lagti hain.)
‎
‎Because tired minds don’t argue.
‎
‎They don’t question tone.
‎They don’t notice what’s missing.
‎
‎They hear familiarity
‎and call it safety.
‎
‎I wanted to answer.
‎
‎Not the door.
‎
‎The voice.
‎
‎(Kyunki jab awaaz apni lagti hai,
‎toh khatra pehchaan se bahar ho jaata hai.)
‎
‎I realized then what the book was using.
‎
‎Not my memories.
‎
‎My trust.
‎
‎It didn’t need me to forget his voice.
‎
‎It just needed me to believe it.
‎
‎That was worse.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi bharosa hi sabse bada trap hota hai.)
‎
‎The book opened on its own again.
‎
‎Slower this time.
‎
‎As if it wanted me to notice.
‎
‎The page was blank for a moment.
‎
‎Then the ink bled through.
‎
‎If you read this book at night,
‎it reads you back.
‎
‎The sentence felt unfinished.
‎
‎Like it was still happening.
‎
‎(Raat mein likhe shabd
‎wapas padhte hain.)
‎
‎I thought of my dreams.
‎
‎How they had stopped feeling random.
‎
‎Faces repeating.
‎Rooms I didn’t recognize,
‎but knew how to move through.
‎
‎They weren’t dreams anymore.
‎
‎They were revisions.
‎
‎The book wasn’t showing me memories.
‎
‎It was checking them.
‎
‎(Jaise koi file dobara khol raha ho.)
‎
‎That’s why mornings felt wrong.
‎
‎I woke up rested,
‎but incomplete.
‎
‎As if parts of me had been reviewed
‎and quietly removed.
‎
‎I couldn’t remember what.
‎
‎Only that something was missing.
‎
‎And the book knew exactly what it was.
‎
‎(Kuch cheezein yaad nahi rehti,
‎par jagah chhod jaati hain.)
‎
‎The page turned once more.
‎
‎No new words appeared.
‎
‎That scared me more than ink ever could.
‎
‎Because it meant the book
‎was no longer writing rules.
‎
‎It was observing results.
‎
‎I closed it.
‎
‎Too late.
‎
‎(Raat sirf waqt nahi hoti,
‎process hoti hai.)
‎
‎I set the book down.
‎
‎Closed it.
‎
‎Pressed my palm flat against the cover,
‎as if weight could stop words.
‎
‎The room stayed still.
‎
‎For a moment,
‎I believed it had worked.
‎
‎Then the sound came.
‎
‎Not a page turning.
‎
‎Writing.
‎
‎Slow.
‎Deliberate.
‎
‎You can close the book.
‎
‎I froze.
‎
‎The sentence continued.
‎
‎You can’t stop it from writing.
‎
‎(Kuch cheezein band karne se
‎rukti nahi hain.)
‎
‎
‎The sound didn’t come from the book.
‎
‎It came from everywhere else.
‎
‎The wall beside the bed.
‎The mirror.
‎The back of my phone screen.
‎
‎Letters forming,
‎then vanishing.
‎
‎The book didn’t need pages.
‎
‎It needed surfaces.
‎
‎(Jahan jagah ho,
‎wahan likha jaa sakta hai.)
‎
‎
‎That’s why closing it felt useless.
‎
‎The book wasn’t an object.
‎
‎It was a process.
‎
‎A habit.
‎
‎Once it started,
‎it looked for places to continue.
‎
‎I realized then—
‎
‎burning it wouldn’t help.
‎
‎Neither would throwing it away.
‎
‎(Kyunki aadat jagah badal leti hai.)
‎
‎
‎The writing stopped suddenly.
‎
‎Not finished.
‎
‎Paused.
‎
‎As if waiting for me to relax.
‎
‎For me to forget it was there.
‎
‎That’s when I understood
‎why no one escapes the book.
‎
‎They don’t lose it.
‎
‎They stop noticing it.
‎
‎(Aur jo cheez nazar se utar jaaye,
‎woh hi sabse zyada paas hoti hai.)
‎
‎The book opened without a sound.
‎
‎The page was already marked.
‎
‎As if it had been waiting
‎for me to stop resisting.
‎
‎The ink was darker this time.
‎
‎He does not own this book.
‎
‎I felt a tightness in my throat.
‎
‎The sentence continued.
‎
‎He belongs to it.
‎
‎(Maalik koi aur hota hai.
‎Naam sirf reh jaata hai.)
‎I understood then
‎why his voice sounded tired.
‎
‎Why it felt familiar,
‎but wrong.
‎
‎He wasn’t calling me.
‎
‎He was being used.
‎
‎The book wasn’t speaking like my father.
‎
‎It was speaking through him.
‎
‎(Jab koi beech mein atak jaata hai,
‎toh awaaz bhi phans jaati hai.)
‎
‎That’s why the voice asked gently.
‎
‎Never demanded.
‎
‎Never threatened.
‎
‎It didn’t need to.
‎
‎It knew I would listen.
‎
‎Not because I was afraid.
‎
‎Because I cared.
‎
‎(Mohabbat bhi kabhi-kabhi
‎sabse bada amplifier hoti hai.)
‎
‎The page turned once more.
‎
‎No new rule.
‎
‎Just a final line,
‎smaller than the rest.
‎
‎He helps it remember.
‎
‎I closed my eyes.
‎
‎Because if that was true—
‎
‎then every time I heard him,
‎
‎the book was getting stronger.
‎
‎(Aur main kamzor.)
‎The book waited.
‎
‎Not open.
‎Not closed.
‎
‎Patient.
‎
‎When the ink returned,
‎it did not hurry.
‎
‎Once you forget why you are afraid,
‎you will open the door yourself.
‎
‎The line sat there.
‎
‎Calm.
‎Certain.
‎
‎(No warning sounds dangerous
‎jab woh sach lagne lage.)
‎
‎
‎I finally understood the design.
‎
‎Fear was never the enemy.
‎
‎Fear was the lock.
‎
‎When it faded,
‎nothing stood between me
‎and the door.
‎
‎The book didn’t force entry.
‎
‎It trained consent.
‎
‎(Jab darr chala jaata hai,
‎toh haath khud aage badhta hai.)
‎
‎That’s why the rules came late.
‎
‎After the calm.
‎After the trust.
‎After the tiredness.
‎
‎By the time you read them,
‎they explain what you’ve already done.
‎
‎Not how to stop it.
‎
‎(Kitaab raasta nahi batati.
‎Bas batati hai tum kaahan aa gaye ho.)
‎
‎Somewhere in the house,
‎a door shifted.
‎
‎Not knocked.
‎
‎Not pushed.
‎
‎Opened.
‎
‎I didn’t move.
‎
‎I didn’t need to.
‎
‎The book closed itself.
‎
‎Satisfied.
‎
‎(Kyunki ab darwaza
‎mujhe kholna nahi tha.)
‎
‎The door was open.
‎
‎And I could no longer remember
‎why that was a bad thing.
‎
‎
‎CHAPTER 3 : The First Thing I Forgot :- 
‎
‎Morning came without warning.
‎
‎No alarm.
‎No gradual light.
‎
‎Just awareness.
‎
‎I was standing in the kitchen,
‎holding a glass of water,
‎mid-sip.
‎
‎I didn’t remember getting there.
‎
‎(The body moves
‎even when memory doesn’t.)
‎
‎TheThe house looked normal.
‎
‎Too normal.
‎
‎Sunlight on the counter.
‎Dust in the corners.
‎The clock ticking again.
‎
‎Everything behaved.
‎
‎I didn’t.
‎
‎I checked the time.
‎
‎8:43 a.m.
‎
‎I stared at the numbers,
‎waiting for recognition.
‎
‎It didn’t come.
‎
‎(Mujhe samajh aa gaya—
‎kuchh chhota sa gaya hai.) glass trembled in my hand.
‎
‎Not from fear.
‎
‎From delay.
‎
‎As if the feeling
‎was late.
‎
‎The house looked normal.
‎
‎Too normal.
‎
‎Sunlight on the counter.
‎Dust in the corners.
‎The clock ticking again.
‎
‎Everything behaved.
‎
‎I didn’t.
‎
‎I checked the time.
‎
‎8:43 a.m.
‎
‎I stared at the numbers,
‎waiting for recognition.
‎
‎It didn’t come.
‎
‎(Mujhe samajh aa gaya—
‎kuchh chhota sa gaya hai.)
‎
‎I tried to remember last night.
‎
‎The knock.
‎The rules.
‎The voice.
‎
‎The memories were there—
‎but flat.
‎
‎Like photographs
‎without sound.
‎
‎I knew something bad had happened.
‎
‎I just couldn’t remember
‎why it mattered.
‎
‎(Aur jab wajah bhool jao,
‎toh galti sahi lagti hai.)
‎
‎That’s when I noticed it.
‎
‎The space on the fridge door.
‎
‎A blank rectangle,
‎slightly darker than the rest.
‎
‎As if something had been removed.
‎
‎A note.
‎A reminder.
‎A warning.
‎
‎I knew it had been important.
‎
‎I also knew
‎I had taken it down myself.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi hum
‎apni hi hifazat hata dete hain.)
‎I opened the fridge.
‎
‎Milk.
‎Leftovers.
‎A folded paper
‎caught between two magnets.
‎
‎My handwriting.
‎
‎Sharp.
‎Urgent.
‎
‎DON’T OPEN THE DOOR.
‎
‎I read it twice.
‎
‎It felt dramatic.
‎
‎Unnecessary.
‎
‎I smiled without meaning to.
‎
‎(Jo cheez darr paida karti hai,
‎pehle wahi funny lagti hai.)
‎
‎I tried to remember
‎why I had written it.
‎
‎The reason stayed just out of reach.
‎
‎Like a word on the tip of the tongue.
‎
‎I folded the paper again.
‎
‎Neater this time.
‎
‎I didn’t throw it away.
‎
‎I just… adjusted it.
‎
‎So it wouldn’t be the first thing I saw.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi hum sach ko
‎thoda side me rakh dete hain.)
‎
‎That’s when the sound came.
‎
‎Not a knock.
‎
‎A movement.
‎
‎Soft footsteps
‎from the hallway.
‎
‎Too slow to be hurried.
‎
‎Too familiar to be strange.
‎
‎My chest stayed calm.
‎
‎That worried me.
‎
‎(Kyunki ab darr
‎time pe nahi aa raha tha.)
‎“Dad?”
‎
‎The word slipped out
‎before I could stop it.
‎
‎It felt right.
‎
‎Comforting.
‎
‎Wrong.
‎
‎The footsteps paused.
‎
‎Then resumed.
‎
‎Closer now.
‎
‎I didn’t move.
‎
‎I didn’t need to.
‎
‎(The body had already decided.)
‎
‎A shape appeared at the end of the hallway.
‎
‎Not stepping into the light.
‎Not hiding from it.
‎
‎Standing exactly where the shadow
‎was supposed to fall.
‎
‎He looked like my father.
‎
‎Enough to pass.
‎Enough to hurt.
‎
‎But his eyes didn’t blink.
‎
‎Not once.
‎
‎(Milna aur pehchaan alag cheezein hoti hain.)
‎
‎“Come here,” he said.
‎
‎The voice was perfect.
‎
‎Too perfect.
‎
‎Every pause in the right place.
‎Every softness intact.
‎
‎My feet moved.
‎
‎I noticed the distance first.
‎
‎No matter how many steps I took,
‎he stayed the same distance away.
‎
‎As if space itself
‎was being rewritten.
‎
‎(Tab mujhe samajh aaya—
‎yeh chalna nahi,
‎bulawa tha.)
‎
‎I caught my reflection in the mirror
‎by the hallway table.
‎
‎My face was calm.
‎
‎Too calm.
‎
‎Behind me,
‎the hallway was empty.
‎
‎No shape.
‎No shadow.
‎
‎But in the glass,
‎he was there.
‎
‎Standing where I wasn’t looking.
‎
‎(Mirror jhooth nahi bolte.
‎Bas woh dikhate hain jo hum avoid karte hain.)
‎
‎I turned.
‎
‎Nothing.
‎
‎I turned back to the mirror.
‎
‎He was closer now.
‎
‎Still smiling.
‎Still patient.
‎
‎His eyes blinked this time.
‎
‎Not together.
‎
‎One.
‎Then the other.
‎
‎My stomach dropped.
‎
‎(Kuch galtiyaan chhoti hoti hain.
‎Bas unka matlab bada hota hai.)
‎
‎
‎“Dad,” I said again.
‎
‎Softer this time.
‎
‎The mirror version smiled wider,
‎like it had been waiting
‎for the word.
‎
‎The real hallway stayed empty.
‎
‎That should have scared me.
‎
‎It didn’t.
‎
‎I felt… relief.
‎
‎As if the house had finally
‎chosen a shape.
‎
‎(Kabhi-kabhi dimaag
‎khali jagah bhar deta hai.)
‎
‎The book slid across the table
‎without a sound.
‎
‎It stopped at my feet.
‎
‎Open.
‎
‎A new line waited there,
‎already half-formed.
‎
‎You will trust what feels familiar.
‎
‎I didn’t read it out loud.
‎
‎I didn’t need to.
‎
‎I was already doing it.
‎
‎(Bharosa aksar pehle aata hai,
‎sach baad mein.)
‎
‎The mirror went dark.
‎
‎Not cracked.
‎Not broken.
‎
‎Blank.
‎
‎Like it had finished its job.
‎
‎I stepped forward.
‎
‎Not toward the hallway.
‎
‎Toward the door at the end of it.
‎
‎The one I didn’t remember opening.
‎
‎The one that was already ajar.
‎
‎(Darwaze yaad nahi rehte.
‎Bas khule milte hain.)
‎
‎The voice came from behind me now.
‎
‎Close.
‎
‎Right.
‎
‎“Good,” it said.
‎
‎Not pleased.
‎Not proud.
‎
‎Certain.
‎
‎I nodded without realizing it.
‎
‎My hand reached out.
‎
‎I stopped thinking
‎about why I shouldn’t.
‎
‎(Kyunki wajah
‎sabse pehle jaati hai.)
‎
‎The book closed itself.
‎
‎Satisfied.
‎
‎The room breathed out.
‎
‎I opened the door.
‎
‎Nothing rushed in.
‎
‎No shadow.
‎No sound.
‎
‎Just space.
‎
‎Waiting to be filled.
‎
‎And somewhere inside me,
‎the first real fear slipped away—
‎quietly.
‎
‎(Bas itna hi chahiye tha.)
‎
‎The space beyond the door
‎was smaller than it should have been.
‎
‎Not dark.
‎
‎Just unfinished.
‎
‎Like a room waiting
‎for furniture that never arrived.
‎
‎I stepped inside.
‎
‎The air felt thin.
‎
‎Not cold.
‎Not warm.
‎
‎Empty.
‎
‎(Jahan yaadein nahi hoti,
‎wahan hawa bhi halka hoti hai.)
‎
‎
‎The door closed behind me.
‎
‎No sound.
‎
‎No resistance.
‎
‎I didn’t turn around.
‎
‎I already knew
‎what I wouldn’t see.
‎
‎A question formed—
‎then faded.
‎
‎I tried to hold it.
‎
‎It slipped.
‎
‎Like soap in water.
‎
‎(Sawal bhi yaad maangte hain.)
‎Something moved in the empty room.
‎
‎Not toward me.
‎
‎Around me.
‎
‎Circling.
‎
‎Learning.
‎
‎I felt observed,
‎but not watched.
‎
‎Assessed.
‎
‎Chosen.
‎
‎My pulse stayed steady.
‎
‎That was wrong.
‎
‎(Kyunki ab darr
‎zaroori tha.)
‎
‎The book appeared in my hands.
‎
‎I don’t remember picking it up.
‎
‎It was lighter now.
‎
‎Thinner.
‎
‎As if it had given something away.
‎
‎A final line waited on the page.
‎
‎You won’t miss what you no longer feel.
‎
‎I read it once.
‎
‎Then forgot
‎why it mattered.
‎
‎(Jab mehsoos hi na ho,
‎toh nuksaan kaisa.)
‎
‎The room finished forming.
‎
‎Walls settled.
‎The ceiling locked in place.
‎
‎It looked like my house.
‎
‎Enough to fool me.
‎
‎I smiled.
‎
‎That scared the part of me
‎that still knew how.
‎
‎Somewhere,
‎a door opened again.
‎
‎This time—
‎
‎I didn’t even notice.
‎
‎I stood in the kitchen,
‎trying to remember what I had forgotten.
‎
‎The answer didn’t come.
‎
‎Instead, the house adjusted around me,
‎as if it already knew.
‎
‎That’s when I realized—
‎
‎whatever I had lost,
‎was still here.
‎
‎Just not for me.

‎— The House That Learn 
‎
‎
‎CHUNK 1 (Lines 1–15)
‎
‎I woke up in my bed.
‎
‎That should have comforted me.
‎
‎It didn’t.
‎
‎The ceiling fan spun at the right speed.
‎The light came through the same crack in the curtain.
‎
‎Everything was correct.
‎
‎Too correct.
‎
‎(Jab sab kuch bilkul theek ho, tab hi kuch galat hota hai.)
‎
‎I sat up slowly.
‎
‎The house felt alert.
‎
‎Not alive.
‎Not watching.
‎
‎Learning.
‎
‎The floor creaked when I put my feet down.
‎CHUNK 2 (Lines 16–30)
‎
‎Not randomly.
‎
‎Exactly where it always used to.
‎
‎As if it remembered my weight.
‎
‎(Ghar yaadein rakhta hai — par yaad ka matlab hamesha safe nahi hota.)
‎
‎I walked toward the door.
‎
‎It was already unlocked.
‎
‎I was sure I had locked it.
‎
‎The handle was warm.
‎
‎Not heat-warm.
‎
‎Used-warm.
‎
‎Like a hand had rested there recently";
